## Project: Nodal Analysis for Gas Well Performance

- Conducted nodal analysis to evaluate gas well performance by plotting Inflow Performance Relationship (IPR) and Tubing Performance Relationship (TPR) curves.
- Used Python with pandas and matplotlib for data processing and visualization, comparing IPR and TPR curves to assess well productivity and optimize operations.
- Provided insights into well performance across different tubing sizes, supporting operational decision-making.
